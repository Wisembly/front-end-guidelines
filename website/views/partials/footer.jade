    p.s-Paragraph The first commit was pushed during fall 2014. It was the result of various challenges. From this moment, we are developing two products and Tapestry is a guarantee to keep three principles in mind: organization, maintenability, DRY.
    p.s-Paragraph Tapestry is currently maintened by a team of 6 various experts: 1 UI designer, 1 product designer, 2 UI developers and 2 JS developers.
    p.s-Paragraph Open-source has always been a part of our company culture. We are baking projects such as #[a(href="http://parsleyjs.org/") Parsley, a form validator], Elephant.io and #[a(href="http://wisembly.github.io/basil.js/") Basil.js, a JS smart persistence layerâ€¦]
